                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I'm a 32 year old visual artist, gallery worker and computer enthusiast currently living in Sydenham, South London.

                    <p>
                        Over the last eight years I've been a gallery Invigilator, Receptionist, Art Handler and Registrar, trying to make and exhibit my own artworks in between. As an artist I mainly make paintings or video, but Iâ€™ve made a few webpage artworks in the past as well. The background images in my carousel were edited from paintings I made recently.

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        For the last two years I've been Exhibitions Manager at <a href="https://www.white-rainbow.art/" target="_blank">White Rainbow</a>. Working with artists, curators and writers we made some really exciting and well-received shows. White Rainbow has recently closed for an extended hiatus, leaving me with an opportunity to pause and consider my next step.

                    <p>
                        Art has always been my main passion and has turned into a career, but I have always enjoyed tinkering with computers. I built my own PC for video editing and gaming, and over the last year started experimenting with Linux and took a couple of computer security short courses on udemy. Working on the prerequisites I've really enjoyed Codewars for its logic challenges, and I'm hoping to branch out into other languages like Python and php in the future. Hopefully as I get better at coding in general my scope for messing around with computers will improve too!

                    <p>
                        Aside from all that I'm a music-lover, play football and tennis at a pretty average level, and I'm trying my best to look after my garden. I bought a car just a few months ago, and have been enjoying doing the rounds of the nearby National Trust spots over the summer.

                    <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The internet has long been a site for artistic experimentation (see <a href="https://www.net-art.org/" target="_blank">NET-ART</a> and <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/" target="_blank">Net Art Anthology</a>), but now that computer-driven tech and connectivity are so intertwined with our daily lives, artists increasingly use those tools as a way to respond to and reflect on the modern world. This reflection is not only expressed in technology itself, but also explores and echoes the open-source ethic of programmers, with a focus on collaboration, peer-production, and social or community engagement. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        At the same time, galleries and museums must increasingly consider the internet as a method for display and experience of art, and as a growing means for the mechanics of buying and selling. Between commercial factors and technological projects, I think that visual art could throw up some fantastic opportunities for coders in the near future. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Ultimately I would love to have the skills and know-how to either create or work on web platforms that can diversify and improve the experience of visual art, or on inventive coded art projects. It would be a way to marry two of my greatest interests, and allow me to engage with an area of the art world that is rapidly expanding in scale and importance.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        As a beginning to that journey, the collaborative, project-based learning and bootcamp structure of the FAC course would seem to be a close analogue to that of arts education and exhibition projects. As a familiar learning environment I believe that I would quickly thrive, and be able to get the most out of the course. I am curious to see a peer-led model in action with coding rather than in an arts setting, where it is generally very positive in my experience.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Hopefully, with the support FAC offer in finding employment after graduation I will be able to step quickly into an industry position, learn more, hone my skills, and eventually turn them back towards the art world.
