                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I'm a 32 year old visual artist, gallery worker and computer enthusiast currently living in Sydenham, South London.

                    <p>
                        Over the last eight years in London I've been a gallery Invigilator, Receptionist, Art Handler and Registrar, trying to make and exhibit my own artworks in between. As an artist I mainly make paintings or video, but I have made several webpage based experiments in the past too. The images in my carousel are edited from paintings I have made recently

                    <p>
                        For the last two years I've been Exhibitions Manager at <a href="https://www.white-rainbow.art/" target="_blank">White Rainbow</a>, responsible for design and production of exhibitions, promotional material and events. Working with artists, curators, technicians and writers we made some really exciting and well-received shows. Despite this, White Rainbow has recently closed its doors for an extended hiatus, leaving me with an opportunity to pause and consider my next step.

                        Art has always been my main passion and has turned into a career, but I have always enjoyed tinkering with computers. I built my own PC for video editing and gaming, and over the last year I began experimenting with Linux and took a couple of computer security short courses on Udemy.com. Since starting on the prerequisites for FAC I've really enjoyed Codewars for its logic challenges, and I'm hoping to branch out into other languages like Python and php in the future. Hopefully as I get better at coding in general my scope for messing around with computers will improve too!

                        Aside from all that I'm a music-lover, play football and tennis at a pretty average level, and I'm trying my best to look after my garden. I bought a car just a few months ago, and have been enjoying doing the rounds of the National Trust and English Heritage locations nearby London this summer.

                    <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The internet has been a site for artistic experimentation since it was publicly available (see <a href="https://www.net-art.org/" target="_blank">net-art projects</a> and <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/" target="_blank">Net Art Anthology</a>), but now that computer driven tech and the internet are so intertwined with our daily lives, artists increasingly use those tools as a way to respond to and reflect on the modern world. This reflection is not only expressed in technology itself, but often explores and echoes the open-souce, community driven ethic of programmers with a focus on collaboration, participation, positive development and adaptability.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        At the same time, galleries and museums must increasingly consider the internet as a method for display and experience of art, and as a growing means for the mechanics of buying and selling. Between commercial factors and forward-thinking projects, I think that visual art could throw up some fastastic opportunities for coders in the near future.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Ultimately I would love to have the skills and know-how to either create or work towards code-based art projects, or on platforms that can diversify and improve the experience of visual art. It would be a great way to marry two of my greatest interests, and allow me to engage with the art world in a relatively unexplored field that will only grow as time goes on. Also, as a universal language coding offers the opportunity to work anywhere, and collaborate with people worldwide who I may never otherwise get the chance.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        As a beginning to that journey, the peer-led, collaborative nature of the FAC course would seem to be a close analogue to that of arts education and exhibition projects. As such, I feel that I would be comfortable in that working environment and be able to get the most out of the course. I know from personal experience that this is an effective way of learning and I am interested to see how it works with coding. Additionally, the level of support FAC offers in finding employment after graduation means that hopefully I would be able to hit the industry running, hone my skills, and eventually turn them back towards the art world.
